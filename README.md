Iris Flower Species Classification
This project focuses on analyzing the famous Iris dataset and building a classification model to predict the species of an iris flower based on its measurements. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and is often used for introductory data analysis and classification tasks.

Project Overview
Data Loading and Exploration: Load the Iris dataset, explore its structure, and gain insights into the data.
Data Visualization: Visualize the data to better understand the distribution of variables and relationships between them using seaborn and matplotlib.
Data Preprocessing: Split the data into features (X) and target (y), and then split it further into training and test sets.
Model Training and Evaluation: Train a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier on the training set and evaluate its performance on the test set using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.
Reporting Results: Report the project findings, including the accuracy achieved by the model, the confusion matrix, and the classification report.
Tools and Libraries Used
Python
pandas
seaborn
